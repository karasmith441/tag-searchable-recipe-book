Cook until the curry loses the raw tomato taste.\nAdd the Potatoes and Cauliflower to the Dutch oven and simmer until they're done. If it starts to thicken more than you would like, just add some vegetable stock or just water. Once the veggies are done, salt to taste and adjust any other spices as necessary.\n\n<notes>\nAdapted from {link:https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/aloo-gobi-recipe/}\n",
